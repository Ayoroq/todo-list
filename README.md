# Doings - Todo List Application

A modern, feature-rich todo list application built with vanilla JavaScript, featuring project management, task filtering, and persistent local storage.

## Features

### Task Management

- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks with full form validation
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with confirmation dialogs
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual feedback
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, and Low priority with color-coded indicators

### Project Organization
- **Create Projects**: Organize tasks into custom projects
- **Project Management**: Edit and delete projects with automatic task handling
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to specific projects during creation or editing
- **Project Views**: View all tasks within a specific project

### Advanced Filtering

- **High Priority**: Tasks marked as high priority

### Search & Navigation
- **Real-time Search**: Search tasks by name and description
- **Active State Management**: Visual indicators for current view
- **Unified Navigation**: Seamless switching between filters and projects

### Data Persistence

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking database operations with Promise-based API
- **Relationship Management**: Maintains task-project associations with proper data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Robust database operations with graceful fallback handling

## Architecture

### Modular Design
The application follows a clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules:

- **`module.js`**: Core data models (Task, Project classes) and business logic
- **`events.js`**: Event handling and user interactions
- **`dialog.js`**: Modal dialog management for forms
- **`render.js`**: DOM manipulation and UI rendering
- **`styles.css`**: Modern CSS with custom properties and responsive design

### Key Design Patterns
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient handling of dynamic content
- **Factory Pattern**: Task and Project class constructors
- **Observer Pattern**: Automatic UI updates on data changes
- **Module Pattern**: Clean imports/exports with ES6 modules
- **Promise-based Storage**: Asynchronous IndexedDB operations with proper error handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with Grid and Flexbox
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 with development and production configs
- **Storage**: IndexedDB API for structured client-side storage
- **Icons**: SVG assets
