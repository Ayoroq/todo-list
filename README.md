# Doings - Todo List Application

A modern, feature-rich todo list application built with vanilla JavaScript, featuring project management, task filtering, sorting capabilities, and persistent IndexedDB storage.

## Features

### Task Management
- **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with name, description, due date, and priority levels
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks with full form validation
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with confirmation dialogs
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with visual feedback
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, and Low priority with color-coded indicators
- **Task Sorting**: Sort tasks by due date (ascending/descending) or priority (ascending/descending)

### Project Organization
- **Create Projects**: Organize tasks into custom projects
- **Project Management**: Edit and delete projects with automatic task handling
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to specific projects during creation or editing
- **Project Views**: View all tasks within a specific project
- **Project Descriptions**: Add detailed descriptions to projects

### Advanced Filtering
- **All Tasks**: View complete task list
- **Today**: Tasks due today (local time)
- **Overdue**: Past due incomplete tasks
- **This Week**: Tasks due within current week (Sunday to Saturday)
- **Completed**: All finished tasks
- **High Priority**: Tasks marked as high priority

### Search & Navigation
- **Real-time Search**: Search tasks by name and description with instant results
- **Active State Management**: Visual indicators for current view
- **Unified Navigation**: Seamless switching between filters and projects
- **Sort Dropdown**: Interactive dropdown with click-outside-to-close functionality

### Data Persistence
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Modern browser database for structured data storage
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking database operations with Promise-based API
- **Relationship Management**: Maintains task-project associations with proper data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Robust database operations with graceful fallback handling
- **Local Time Support**: All date operations use local timezone

## Architecture

### Modular Design
The application follows a clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules:

- **`src/module.js`**: Core data models (Task, Project classes), business logic, and IndexedDB operations
- **`src/events.js`**: Event handling, user interactions, and dropdown management
- **`src/dialog.js`**: Modal dialog management for task/project forms
- **`src/render.js`**: DOM manipulation, UI rendering, and sort dropdown creation
- **`src/utils.js`**: HTML sanitization utilities for XSS prevention
- **`src/styles.css`**: Modern CSS with custom properties, responsive design, and dropdown styling
- **`src/index.js`**: Application initialization and module coordination
- **`src/template.html`**: HTML template for webpack
- **`assets/`**: SVG icons for UI elements

### Key Design Patterns
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient handling of dynamic content with unified event listeners
- **Factory Pattern**: Task and Project class constructors with validation
- **Module Pattern**: Clean imports/exports with ES6 modules
- **Promise-based Storage**: Asynchronous IndexedDB operations with proper error handling
- **State Management**: Centralized sort state tracking and active view rendering
- **Security-First**: XSS prevention through HTML sanitization and safe DOM manipulation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with async/await
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 with development and production configurations
- **Storage**: IndexedDB API for structured client-side storage
- **Icons**: SVG assets (plus.svg, sort.svg)
- **Security**: Input validation and XSS prevention
- **Testing**: Basic test setup with HTML/CSS files
